</div>

A general-purpose dataflow programming language with static types and implicit parallelism. Compiles to machine code and Go.

## üöÄ Features

- Dataflow programming
- Implicit parallelism
- Compiles to machine code and Go
- Garbage collection
- Strong static typing
- Clean C-like syntax
- ...And more!

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is currently under heavy development and is not yet ready for production use.

## üîß Quick Start

### Installation

For Mac OS and Linux:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nevalang/neva/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

If your device is connected to a chinese network:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nevalang/neva/main/scripts/cnina/install.sh | bash
```

For Windows (see [issue](https://github.com/nevalang/neva/issues/499) with Windows Defender, try manual download from [releases](https://github.com/nevalang/neva/releases) if installation won't work):

```batch
curl -o installer.bat -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nevalang/neva/main/scripts/install.bat && installer.bat
```

### Hello World

First, use Neva CLI to create a project template

```bash
neva new my_awesome_project
```

Then run it

```bash
neva run my_awesome_project/src
```

You should see the following output

```bash
Hello, World!
```

If you open `my_awesome_project/src/main.neva` with your favorite IDE you'll see this

```neva
import { fmt }

def Main(start) (stop) {
	fmt.Println
	---
	:start -> { 'Hello, World!' -> println -> :stop }
}
```

The `import { fmt }` statement imports the standard library's `fmt` package which provides common formatting and printing functionality. The `Main` component has `start` inport and `stop` outport, with a `println` node (instance of stdlib's `fmt.Println`). The network after `---` shows: on `start` message, `"Hello, World!"` is sent to `println`, then program terminates via `stop` signal.

## üöß Roadmap

Nevalang is in its early stages, but community support can help it grow into a mature, feature-rich language.

- Grow community and improve docs
- Expand stdlib (including test-framework)
- Better syntax and more features
- Enhance developer experience (lsp, debugger, etc)
- Implement **Go interoperability** (call Go from Neva and vice versa)
- Enable **visual programming** in VSCode

We seek contributors to join our small team.

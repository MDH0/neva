## ü§î What Is Nevalang?

Nevalang is a new kind of programming language where instead of writing step-by-step instructions you create **networks** where data flows between **nodes** as **immutable messages** and everything runs **in parallel by default**. After **type-checking**, your program is compiled into **machine code** and can be distributed as a **single executable** with zero dependencies.

All this combined with native **stream processing** support and features such as **advanced error handling** makes Nevalang a perfect choice for **cloud applications** with **high concurrency**.

Future updates will include **visual programming** and **Go interoperability** to allow gradual adoption and leverage existing ecosystem.

## üî• Features

- üì® **Dataflow Programming** - Write programs as message-passing graphs
- üîÄ **Implicit Parallelism** - Everything is parallel by default, no async-await/threads/goroutines/etc.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Strong Static Typing** - Robust type system with generics and pattern-matching
- üöÄ **Machine Code Compilation** - Compile for any Go-supported platform, including WASM
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Stream Processing** - Handle real-time data with streams as first class citizens
- üßØ **Advanced Error Handling** - Errors as values with `?` operator to avoid boilerplate
- ü™∂ **Minimal Core** - Simple language with limited abstractions
- üì¶ **Package Manager** - Publish packages by pushing a git-tag
- üß© **Functional Patterns** - Immutability and higher-order components
- üîå **Dependency Injection** - Modularity with interfaces and DI
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Garbage Collection** - Automatic memory management using Go's low-latency GC
- üåà **Visual Programming** (WIP): Edit programs as visual graphs
- üîÑ **Go Interoperability** (WIP): Call Go from Neva and Neva from Go
- üïµ **NextGen Debugging** (WIP): Observe execution in realtime and intercept messages on the fly

## üëã Hello, World!

```neva
import { fmt }

def Main(start any) (stop any) {
	println fmt.Println<string>
	---
	:start -> 'Hello, World!' -> println -> :stop
}
```

What‚Äôs happening here:

- `import { fmt }` loads the `fmt` package for printing
- `def Main` defines the main component with input port `start` and output port `stop`
- `:start -> ‚ÄòHello, World!‚Äô -> println -> :stop` defines a connection that sends `Hello, World!` string to the `println` printer-node and then terminates the program

## üì¢ Community

As you can see, this is quite an ambitious project. Typically, such projects are backed by companies, but Nevalang is maintained by a very small group of enthusiasts. Your support by joining us will show interest and motivate us to continue.

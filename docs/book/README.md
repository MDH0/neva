# The Book

Welcome to "The Book" - an in-depth resource on Nevalang. This extension to the tutorial and style guide provides a deeper understanding of the language's inner workings. While the tutorial helps you start programming in Nevalang, this book explores advanced concepts and features. It is recommended for those seeking a thorough understanding of the language, but can be read at your own pace.

This book is designed to be read sequentially, as each chapter builds upon concepts introduced in previous ones. However, you can also use it as a reference by jumping to specific topics of interest.

> If you just want to get your feet wet, read the [tutorial](../tutorial.md) instead.
